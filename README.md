This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for our employees to use on a personal Smartphone. It displays a business card for work, a XMPP-ID and a business card for private use.  The application was created as a conviniend way for the developer to test new concepts and technologie while making something usefull at the same time.  Making the code Open Source was done for the following reasons:      We have no business case which would benefit from this application to be propietary.     We want to be able to learn from others, who work wiith code derived from this project.     We'd like to see many people using Smart Business Card Applications on their phone, so it will be more convinient for our employees to use this application.
