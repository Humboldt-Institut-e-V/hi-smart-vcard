## Description

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for our employees to use on a personal Smartphone. It displays a business card for work, a XMPP-ID and a business card for private use.

The application was created as a convenient way for the developer to test new concepts and technology while making something useful at the same time.

This applications interface and users documentation is in German. To learn the language please visit: https://www.humboldt-institut.org/
